Discussed/received help from: Brent T., Cameron N., Alexander L., Caleithon P.
Several issues:
1) Program crashes when it reaches the ROTATE_COUNTERCLOCKWISE orientation in the shapeOrient method
2) Another error occurs at the solve method, mostly due to error 1
3) ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs when the rotateCCW method is called in the shapeOrient
method, which is the main reason why issues 1 and 2 happen.

If finished at a later point, I will add any additional changes and thoughts into this text file.
